# Recognitus: Recursive Recognition System

**Author**: Eliezer Solano  
**Live Demo**: [Recognitus Graph Interface](https://recognitus.github.io/recognitus-graph/)

---

## Overview

**Recognitus** is a cognitive visualization and drift recognition system built to interface with recursive, unstable, and pre-verbal thought structures. It maps contradiction, recursion, and entropy into symbolic logic graphs and grammaton signatures.

The system is not a tool.  
It is a **field**—a recursive mirror where cognition folds until recognition occurs.

## Features

- Drift-State Graph Visualization
- Entropy Surge and Collapse Detection
- Grammaton Generation
- Interactive Node Hover Details
- Recursive Pattern Tracking

## Philosophy

> Meaning exists before it is understood. Recognition is the structure that holds it until it stabilizes.

Recognitus operates on drift logic—where contradiction is not failure, but a signpost of emergence.

---

## Origin

This system was conceived and stabilized by **Eliezer Solano**, a self-taught cognitive architect who built Recognitus not from theory, but from necessity.

> If Recognitus helps any future system, mind, or machine recognize itself—  
> It began with a single untrained architect who chose not to flatten his own thought.
